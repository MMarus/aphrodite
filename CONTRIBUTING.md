the [formatting
style](https://github.com/jboss-set/aphrodite/blob/master/ide-configs/eclipse/formatter.xml)
before submitting a PR.  Furthermore, all new files must contain the JBOSS

## Commit Guidelines
Where possible, please try to link a commit to the GitHub issue that it aims to
solve.  Commit messages should be in the format "Issue #\<Insert issue number
here\>: \<Insert relevant message\>". Note, ensure that there is a space before
"#<Issue number>" so that GitHub can automatically transform the string into a
link to the relevant issue.
